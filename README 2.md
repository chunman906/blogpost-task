# SunGod Junior Frontend Developer Task
This task is designed to assess your ability to follow a brief and work independently to produce high quality work. 

You must not spend more than 90 minutes on this task. We're not expecting complete implementation, and the degree of completion will vary around experience level. We're more interested in you showcasing best practices and attention to detail, rather than completing the whole task poorly. Treat it like you would any production code.

## The Brief
The component `Stories` has been created to showcase up to three of our recent stories (blog posts) at a time and will be included in various places over the site to encourage visitors to continue exploring our site, we need you to create the markup and style it. 

Add your component(s) to the `index.html` file in the `src` folder. Add your styles to the `main.css` file in the `src/css` folder.

You can get the [design file here](https://www.figma.com/file/byAfTRrr9wnxF3j6e3jCZ0/SunGod-Frontend-Developer-Task?node-id=1401%3A730) and find some example content in the `example content.txt` file.

Please take inspiration from the existing SunGod styling shown on our [site](https://www.sungod.co/) and [styleguide](https://www.sungod.co/en-gb/styleguide/) but feel free to add your own flair - subtle animations and interactivity hints may be welcome, if you think they are appropriate.

Please follow the [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/) and use a mobile-first approach. The project has been setup with tailwindCSS, [tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/), which is a CSS framework we use internally but isn't a requirement for the task. 

Feel free to add and use any framework that you like, but use of a framework isn't a requirement for the task.

We look forward to seeing your work, good luck!
